- AVL tree
  - first self-balance tree
  - A balancing factor is allocated for each node in the AVL tree, based on whether the tree is balanced or not.
    - the correct balance factor is 1, 0 and -1
  - If the tree has a new node, it will be rotated to ensure that it is balanced
  - Common operations such as viewing, insertion, and removal take O(log n) time
