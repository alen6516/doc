# C11 recommends to use int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t
# uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t to avoid dependence problem.


# use 
char const *arr[] = {"abc", "def", "ghi"};
# rather than
char *arr[] = {"abc", "def", "ghi"};



# process
## process exit
exit(int status)
    * all functions registered in atexit() and on_exit() are called
    * return status to caller (command line) 

_exit(int status)
    * exit the process immediately
    * close all file descriptors
    * any children are inherited by process 1
    * the process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal


# pthread
pthread_join()
    * The pthread_join() subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified threadid thread terminates.
    * join, mutex and condition variable are 3 synchronization ways of pthread
    * If a thread is created as detached.

## pthread exit
pthread_exit()
    * in main(), if main() finishes before threads it spawned exit, all its child threads are terminated, but if call pthread_exit() before finishing main(), it will block and support the threads before they are done.
